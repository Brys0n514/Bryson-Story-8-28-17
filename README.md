Item 1: Pushing & Pulling:
	Learning to push and pull information was very hard to learn, but once I figured it out everything went very smoothly. 

Item 2: Branches:
	Using the branches function sounds very cool, however I only understand them in theory. I haven’t had the opportunity to use it extensively, but I am looking forward to it.

Item 3: Partner:
	I haven't had any practice cooperating with branches and sharing on github with anybody yet, however Proffesor Evert has walked us through the process of merging branches and viewing file changes in git via the command line.

Item 4: Class Goals:
	I have some experience with the hardware side of computing but I’ve never been exposed to the software or coding side of it. I want to understand and execute computer codes by the end of the semester. I’m looking forward to the challenge and hopefully some fun memories.
